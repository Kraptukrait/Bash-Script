# 🐧 Bash to the Future – My First Steps with Bash on Linux

**Welcome to the wonderful world of Bash scripts, where `echo` isn’t just shouting into the void, and `chmod +x` is the official knighting ceremony for your code!**
This repository is my personal *"Hello World"* in the Bash universe, created as part of my final exam project. 😄

## 📚 What You’ll Find Here:

A small but mighty introduction to:

* 🔹 The basics of Bash
* 🔹 Simple automation tasks
* 🔹 Mastering loops, conditionals, and other chaos
* 🔹 And of course: plenty of `#!` magic – or maybe not? 👀

## ❗Important Note:

If you run a script and find yourself saying:
**"Why isn't this working?!"**,
it's probably because I *didn't* include the classic **shebang** (`#!/bin/bash`) at the top of the files.

👉 **If you want the scripts to run as proper executables, make sure to add this at the very top of the file:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

Alternatively, you can run them directly using `bash scriptname.sh`.

## 🤓 Who Is This For?

For anyone who:

* is new to Bash
* is prepping for an exam
* likes to chat with the terminal
* or just wants to see how I tried to survive the Bash learning curve

## 🧠 What I Learned:

* That `sudo` is powerful – and should be feared accordingly
* That semicolons are sneakier than they look
* And that Bash scripts are the best kind of to-do lists (they actually complain when you forget something)

## 🛠️ How to Use:

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kraptukrait/Bash-Script.git
   ```
2. Make a script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x scriptname.sh
   ```
3. Optionally add `#!/bin/bash` at the top
4. Let the magic happen:

   ```bash
   ./scriptname.sh
   ```

## 🎓 Final Thoughts

Whether you're cramming for an exam or just dipping your toes into Bash, take a look around, experiment with the scripts, and remember:
If you say `bash`, you better be ready to say `exit 0` too!
